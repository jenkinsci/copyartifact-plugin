  Select "<strong>Flatten directories</strong>" to ignore the directory structure of the artifacts
  in the source project and copy all matching artifacts directly into the specified
  target directory.  By default the artifacts are copied in the same directory
  structure as the source project.
  </p>
  <p>
  Select "<strong>Optional</strong>" to allow this build to continue even if no build is found
  matching the "Which build" condition selected above, the build's workspace does
  not exist or is inaccessible, or no artifacts are found matching the specified
  pattern.  By default this build step fails the build if no artifacts are copied.
  </p>
  <p>
  Select "<strong>Fingerprint Artifacts</strong>" to automatically fingerprint all artifacts
  that are copied as part of this build step.
  </p>
  <p>
  Select "<strong>Include Build Number</strong>" to include the source build number in the target path.
  When true, the build number of the source project will be included in the target path.
  This is particularly useful when the selector is specific and the value is a permalink, e.g. lastSuccessfulBuild.
