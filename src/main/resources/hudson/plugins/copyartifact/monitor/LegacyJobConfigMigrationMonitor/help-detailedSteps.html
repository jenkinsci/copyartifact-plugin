<p>You can update configurations in one of following ways:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Automatic migration</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Checking projects and clicking "Migrate the selected project(s)"
      updates configurations adding appropriate
      "Permission to Copy Artifact" configurations
      to the projects listed in "Project with the artifacts".
      </p>
      <p>
      Automatic migration is not applicable to some kind of projects
      that generate configurations automatically, such as multibranch.
      Please apply manual migrations to those projects.
      </p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Manual migration</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      You can migrate projects updating configurations manually.
      </p>
      <p>
      The updated project will be removed from the list automatically
      when the project is built again and it wouldn't fail
      in Production mode. 
      You can see whether the project is built again
      after updating the configuration with checking "Last time" field.
      Auto removal is performed only in Migration mode,
      and you have to remove it manually after you switch Copy Artifact
      to Production mode.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can configure appropriate permissions for Copy Artifact
      in one of following ways:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Configure "Permission to Copy Artifact"</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
          You can configure "Permission to Copy Artifact" to the project
          with artifacts to define which projects are allowed to
          copy artifacts from that project.
          "Migrate the selected project(s)" button does this configuration
          automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
          In pipelines, you can define <code>copyArtifactPermission</code> like this:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Declarative pipeline</dt>
            <dd>
<code><pre>pipeline {
  agent any;
  options {
    // specify projects to allow to copy artifacts with a comma-separated list.
    copyArtifactPermission('job1,job2,...');
  }
  stages{...}
}
</pre></code>
            </dd>
            <dt>Scripted pipeline</dt>
            <dd>
<code><pre>properties([
  // specify projects to allow to copy artifacts with a comma-separated list.
  copyArtifactPermission('job1,job2,...'),
]);
node {
  ...
}
</pre></code>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>Configure  "Access Control for Builds"</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
          You can configure "Access Control for Builds"
          in Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security
          so that builds run with authentication allowed
          to access builds with artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>
          That configuration is shown only when plugins providing
          "Access Control for Builds" features are installed.
          </p>
