Copy artifacts from a build that is a downstream of a build of the specified project.
You can use variable expressions.
</p>
<p>
Downstream builds are found using fingerprints of files.
That is, a build that is triggerd from a build isn't always considered downstream,
but you need to fingerprint files used in builds to let Jenkins track them.

Note: "Downsteram build of" is applicable only to AbstractProject based projects (both upstream and downstream projects).
