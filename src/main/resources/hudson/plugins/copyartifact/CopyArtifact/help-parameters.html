<p>
  Jobs may be filtered to select only builds matching particular parameters or
  other build variables. Use <tt>PARAM=VALUE,...</tt>
  to list the parameter filter; this is the same syntax as described for
  multiconfiguration jobs in <i>Project name</i>
  except with parameters instead of axis values.
  For example, <tt>FOO=bar,BAZ=true</tt> examines only builds
  that ran with parameter <tt>FOO</tt> set to <tt>bar</tt>
  and the checkbox for <tt>BAZ</tt> was checked.

<p>
  You shoudn't use "Build selector for Copy Artifact" parameters here,
  as it doesn't preserve compatibility when you upgrade plugins,
  and doesn't work for builds built before upgrading.
