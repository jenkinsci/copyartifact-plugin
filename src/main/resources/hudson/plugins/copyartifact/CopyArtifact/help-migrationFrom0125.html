<p>
Since Copy Artifact 1.26, you should specify parameters to select builds not in <tt>Project name</tt>, but in <tt>Parameter filters</tt>.
Reconfigure <tt>Project name</tt> and <tt>Parameter filters</tt> in a proper way if you want to filter builds with parameters.
Saving the configuration without reconfiguring may cause sequential builds fail. 
Axes of multi-configuration projects and modules of maven2/3 projects are specified in <tt>Project name</tt> as in Copy Artifact 1.25.
</p>
<p>
Projects configured with Copy Artifact 1.25 behaves as followings:
<dl>
  <dt>Running a build without reconfiguration after update</dt>
    <dd>Migration of the configuration is done automatically with information retrieved in building.</dd>
  <dt>Copying a project without reconfiguration after update</dt>
    <dd>Migration of the configuration is done automatically with information retrieved in copying.</dd>
  <dt>Browse the project configuration page after update</dt>
    <dd>No migration is done for sufficient information about the project cannot be retrieved for the design of Jenkins. <b>Saving the configuration without verifying may break the configuration, and cause build errors.</b></dd>
</dl>
