<div>
  Relative paths to artifact(s) to copy or leave blank to copy all artifacts.
  Check the <tt>/artifact/</tt> browser of a build to see the relative paths
  to use here, as the build page typically hides intermediate directories.
  Can use wildcards like <tt>module/dist/**/*.zip</tt>, and use comma (followed
  by optional whitespace) to separate multiple entries.  See the @includes of
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant fileset</a>
  for the exact format.
  May also contain references to build parameters like <tt>$PARAM</tt>.
